We will implement the Dictionary ADT using two ‘rival’ techniques - the Binary SearchTree (BST) and using Hashing.One file is 
provided to test these two approaches. This is calledspl.cand reads in a file ofcorrectly spelt words (argv[1]) and then a list of 
words to check (argv[2]). The program thenprints out all words in the second file that are incorrectly spelt.Whilst I providespl.c,
you need to provide the dictionary implementation that this programuses. These are the BST approachbst.c/bst.hand the Hashing 
approachhsh.c/hsh.h. Youwill compilespl.calong with each of these two files in turn, to create two executables thatperform the 
same task, but using different underlying methodologies. Much of the compilationis dealt with by the providedMakefile; this also 
specifies which header file (bst.horhsh.h)to put at the very top line ofspl.cusing the-includecompile option.
