The Game of Life was developed by British mathematician John Horton Conway. 
In Life, a boardrepresents the world and each cell a single location. A cell may be either empty or inhabited.
The game has three simple rules, which relate to the cellâ€™s eight nearest neigbours :1.SurvivalAn inhabited cell
remains inhabited if exactly2or3of its neighbouring cells areinhabited.2.DeathAn inhabited cell becomes uninhabited 
if fewer than2,  or more than3of itsneighbours are inhabited.3.BirthAn uninhabited cell becomes inhabited if exactly 3 of
its neighbours are inhabited.The next board is derived solely from the current one. The current board remains unchangedwhile 
computing the next board. 
In the simple case shown here, the boards alternate infinitelybetween these two states
