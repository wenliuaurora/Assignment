The one player game,Conway’s Soldiers(sometimes known asSolitaire Army), is similar to pegsolitaire. 
For this exercise, Conway’s board is a7(width)×8(height) board with tiles on it. Thelower half of the board is entirely 
filled with tiles (pegs), and the upper half is completely empty.A tile can move by jumping another tile, either horizontally 
or vertically (but never diagonally)onto an empty square. 
The jumped tile is then removed from the board. A few possible movesare shown below
